            <h1>Site Purpose</h1>
            <p>When trying to scgedule classes for a semester, students want to 
                look for speific courses that can help them advance in thier majors.
                Many concepts related to what classes you are supposed tot take, such as
                bemchmark or core courses, may seem a bit confusing and many might
                not even know what classes fit these descriptions. Our site was created
                to alliveate that issue by allowing students to choose their majors and search up
                what classes match up to these certain terms and allow them to nake more
                informaed decisions when scheduling for classes.
